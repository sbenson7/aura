            <p class="mb-4">Terry is our rock.  She has been with us from the beginning and is the kindest person you will ever meet.  She is a Supervisor and does most of the new employee training.  Since being part of our team, she is realizing there are so many who silently hurt with invisible conditions, but she is comforted when she hears people are finding different ways to relieve some pain, both physically and emotionally.  Terry enjoys spending time with her husband, Ken, and their three daughters Maxine, Simone and Carly, and Barry, the Beagle-Bassett Hound Dog!  Her favorite foods include salads, wraps, slaw, pizza and flat breads.  Her favorite vacation spot is a beach, any beach will do, as long as there is some good music including acoustic guitar and 70's soul and disco dance music.  She says, "I enjoy meeting and talking with all our great customers that become part of our AURA family.  I love the people and the environment so much."</p>

She is always reading and learning about new ideas and is amazed how many stories she has heard about pink salt helping with inflammation.  Wendy enjoys spending time with her husband, Brian, and their two children, Annabel and Colin and they have three cats named Paulo, Mystic and Autumn.  Her favorite food is artichokes drenched in butter and enjoys an ice-cold Diet Dr Pepper on occasion while listening to various soundtracks.

            <p class="mb-4">Beth is one of the most compassionate people you will ever meet.  She has come to realize the true healing powers of Himalayan Pink Salt and Selenite during her time with us.  Beth and her husband, Jason, have a 5-year old daughter named Libby.  Libby is full of life and loves to visit her Mommy at the Healing Salt CaveÂ®. They have a Pomeranian and two Chihuahuas.  Her favorite foods include things like celery juice and wild blueberries. Speaking of, if anyone is familiar with Anthony Williams, the Medical Medium, Beth healed herself from Epstein Barr infection by studying and following his protocol by using food and plants as medicine.  She is an inspiration to all of us!  She enjoys sewing, learning about herbs and listening to Rockabilly and Rhythm & Blues music.  She says, "the energy at AURA is always so positive and uplifting."</p>
