            <p class="text-black">Far-infrared radiant (FIR) heat provides all the healthy benefits of natural sunlight without any of the dangerous effects of solar radiation. FIR heat actually penetrates and warms the body so the heat energy is not lost trying to warm the air. FIR heat is not ultraviolet radiation, but a narrow band of energy within the 5.6 to 15 micron level.<br><br>

            This type of energy travels 1½ – 2” deep into the body increasing circulation and nourishing damaged tissue.  The FIR heat emitted is a naturally occurring energy that heats objects by direct light conversion. This natural heat increases body temperature which in turn stimulates and improves the immune system.<br><br>

            The FIR heat emitted in the sauna may induce two to three times the sweat volume of conventional saunas and they operate at a much cooler air temperature range.  Many individuals who cannot tolerate a conventional sauna, steam room or sweat lodge will find it to be a pleasant experience.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <br><p>​The infrared sauna technology differs from the more familiar saunas that heat the air with steam or rocks.  This heat emanates from the light at the far end of the spectrum.  For this reason it is often referred to as far infrared sauna therapy.  Because it does not overheat the air, rather, penetrates into skin and muscles, it has been put to use by NASA for it's astronauts and the neonatal units in hospitals to keep babies warm.<br><br>

                ​Far infrared radiant (FIR) heat provides all the healthy benefits of natural sunlight without any of the dangerous effects of solar radiation.  It actually penetrates and warms the body so the heat energy is not lost trying to warm the air.  FIR heat is not ultraviolet radiation but a narrow band of energy within the 5.6 to 15 micron level.  This type of energy travels 1-2" deep into the body increasing circulation and nourishing damaged tissues.<br><br>

                ​Our sessions are 30-45 minutes, it is up to you how long you stay in.  We start the temperature at 115 degrees F and show you how to adjust it from there.  You can go all the way up to 140 degrees F.  If you start to feel over-heated, simply open the sauna door to let in some cooler air.  If you still feel over-heated, we recommend ending your session.<br><br>

                The saunas are comfortable, dry and private; we do not put you in with strangers.  We provide a towel for you to sit on while you are in the sauna along with a smaller towel to wipe your perspiration.  When your session is over, we provide a cool, wet washcloth for you to wipe off with as well as a hand towel to dry off any excess moisture.  There are also unscented "wet-wipe" type cloths available in the room.  You are more than welcome to bring your own towels if you prefer.  Our facility does not have a shower.<br><br>

                ​​Don't expect to sweat right away when you enter the sauna.  It can take a few minutes or more to start sweating noticeably.  If you are new to the sauna, you might find you don't sweat at all the first few times, or even the first several times.  That may sound strange, but some people have suppressed sweating mechanisms due to past pesticide exposure or other toxic exposures.<br><br>

                ​If that is the case for you, take things slowly, realizing you won't be able to tolerate the sauna as long or get the same benefits from it without sweating.  As you keep at it, the problem should correct itself and your ability to sweat may return.  Also remember you need to be well hydrated to get a good sweat going.  If you're not sweating as well as usual in the sauna, try drinking more water.<br><br>

                ​We provide a bottle of water to take in the sauna with you and we encourage you to drink plenty of water before and after your session.  It is important to be well hydrated when taking a sauna.<br><br>

                ​This is your time and it's a time to relax and reflect on your day. Try resting your eyes and mind or meditate for a while as the soft music is playing.</p>

                <button class="accordion">What do I wear in the sauna?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <br><p>​If possible, take your sauna in the nude (remember, you are in a private room).  If you can't, then wear the absolute minimum of clothes you are comfortable in - a bathing suit for example.<br><br>

                Some people think they will sweat more if they enter a sauna with clothes on but this is dangerous and a mistake.  When you cover your skin with clothes, your sweat can't help cool you down by evaporating on your skin.  You will quickly over-heat and also lose the benefits of wiping away your toxin-loaded sweat.  When you wipe away the toxin-filled sweat, the toxins don't sit in contact with your skin and possibly be reabsorbed.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <br><p>​If you're a healthy person - or one whose health issue doesn't prevent sauna use - you can take a sauna every day!  In fact, you can sauna more than once a day if you like.  Dangers of the infrared sauna are few and avoidable.</p>

                <button class="accordion">What are some conditions a far infrared sauna may help?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <br><p>​There are many conditions that saunas have been shown to help with and here are a few:<br><br>

                ​Detoxification; Skin Purification; Fibromyalgia; Headaches; Chronic Fatigue; Lyme Disease; Eczema & Psoriasis; Weight Control; Arthritis & Rheumatism; Acne & Allergies; Soft-Tissue Injury; Menstrual Pain & Menopause; Hypertension; Asthma; Cold & Flu; Depression; Tremors; Joint Pain & Backaches; Anxiety & Insomnia; Chronic Infections; High Cholesterol; Low Blood Sugar; Digestive Disorders; Whiplash; Gastroenteric Problems; Sciatica; Ear Diseases; Shoulder Stiffness; Nervous Tension; Varicose Veins; Stretch Marks; Diabetes; Strained Muscles; Relaxation.<br><br>

                <button class="accordion">What is Chromotherapy?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <br><p>​Chromotherapy, also called color therapy, is the use of color and light to gently bring about homeostasis.  Color and light is applied to specific areas and accupoints on the body.<br><br>

                ​Color and light have been used for healing since the beginning of recorded time.  Ancient Egyptians built solarium-type rooms with colored panes of glass and the sun would shine through the glass and flood the patient with color.  Today, there are many practitioners who use color and light in interesting ways.  Some therapists have a box with a mechanism that flickers light into the eyes.  They report success in speeding the recovery of stoke victims and those persons who experience chronic depression.<br><br>

                ​Why it works...the earth, the oceans, in fact every living thing, is dependent upon light for its very existence.  A recent scientific study disclosed that each cell in the body emits light.  We live in a sea of energy and our bodies are composed of energy.  Color works through and in us, in every nerve, cell, gland and muscle.  It shines in our auras and radiates upon us from the sun.  Color is an active power, exerting a tremendous influence on our consciousness, soul and spirit.<br><br>

                ​Within our body, our organs, muscles, cells and nerves all have a level of vibration.  When our body becomes out of balance, disease occurs.  Each color has its own frequency and vibration.  Through extensive research, we know that color and light will help bring our physical and emotional systems into balance.<br><br>

                ​Our saunas have Chromotherapy lighting so please let us know if there is a particular color you would like while taking your sauna.<br><br>  

                Here is an explanation for each color:<br><br>

                ​<b>RED​</b>  ​brings warmth, energy and stimulation; therefore good for energy, fatigue, colds, chilly and passive people.  It energizes heart and blood circulation.  It energizes all organs and senses.<br><br>

                <b>YELLOW​</b>  increases neuromuscular tone.  Purifies blood, helps digestion and has a cleansing effect.  Strongly stimulates happiness, brings on a sense of security, as well as a strong feeling of well-being.<br><br>

                <b>GREEN​</b>  is a cooling, sedating color, which helps reduce swelling of joints and tissues; it calms the body's nervous system.  It's the color of the relaxed heart.<br><br>

                <b>TURQUOISE​</b>  increases intuition and sensitivity.  It mentally relaxes and tackles embodied psychological barriers.  It acts as a tonifier and can help regulate imbalances in the lung and large intestines system.  It facilitates spiritual growth.<br><br>

                <b>BLUE</b>  ​is a cool color that is calming.  It stimulates the parasympathetic system and reduces blood pressure and calms both breathing and heart-rate.  It helps treat sleep disorders and headaches.<br><br>

                <b>VIOLET</b>  ​promotes awareness and consciousness.  It increases effects of medication.  It promotes proper functioning of the lymphatic system and very helpful with menopause.  It is the color for neutralizing emotional wounds and for spiritual growth.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Medical Conditions - please read!!</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <br><p>​If any of the below apply to you, please consult your physician prior to sauna use:<br><br>

                Cardiovascular Issues, Obesity or Diabetes - Individuals suffering from obesity or with a medical history of heart disease, low or high blood pressure, circulatory problems or diabetes should consult a physician prior to use. Heat stress increases cardiac output and blood flow to transfer internal body heat to the outside environment via the skin (perspiration) and respiratory system. This takes place primarily due to major changes in the heart rate, which has the potential to increase by thirty (30) beats per minute for each degree increase in core body temperature.<br><br>


                Medications - Individuals who are using prescription drugs should seek the advice of their personal physician since some medications may induce drowsiness, while others may affect heart rate, blood pressure and circulation. Diuretics, barbiturates and beta-blockers may impair the body’s natural heat loss mechanisms. Anticholinergics such as amitryptaline may inhibit sweating and can predispose individuals to heat rash or to a lesser extent, heat stroke. Some over-the-counter drugs, such as antihistamines, may also cause the body to be more prone to heat stroke.<br><br>


                Alcohol & Drug Abuse - Contrary to popular belief, it is not advisable to attempt to “sweat out” a hangover. Alcohol intoxication decreases a person’s judgment; therefore, he/she may not realize when the body has a negative reaction to high heat. Alcohol also increases the heart rate, which may be further increased by heat stress. The use of alcohol, drugs or medications prior to a sauna session may lead to unconsciousness.<br><br>


                Elderly - The ability to maintain core body temperature decreases with age. This is primarily due to circulatory conditions and decreased sweat gland function. The body must be able to activate its natural cooling processes to maintain core body temperature. If elderly, operate at a lower temperature and for no more than 15 minutes at a time.<br><br>


                Children - The core body temperature of children rises much faster than adults. This occurs due to a higher metabolic rate per body mass, limited circulatory adaptation to increased cardiac demands and the inability to regulate body temperature by sweating. When using with a child, operate at a lower temperature and for no more than 15 minutes at a time.<br><br>


                Chronic Conditions / Diseases Associated With Reduced Ability To Sweat Or Perspire - Multiple Sclerosis, Central Nervous System Tumors and Diabetes with Neuropathy are conditions that are associated with impaired sweating. Consult a physician.<br><br>


                Hemophiliacs / Individuals Prone To Bleeding - The use of infrared saunas should be avoided by anyone who is predisposed to bleeding.<br><br>


                Fever & Insensitivity to Heat - Individuals with insensitivity to heat or who have a fever should not use the sauna until the fever subsides.<br><br>


                Pregnancy - Pregnant women should consult a physician before using an infrared sauna.<br><br>


                Menstruation - Heating of the low back area of women during the menstrual period may temporarily increase menstrual flow.<br><br> 

                ​

                Joint Injury - Recent (acute) joint injury should not be heated for the first 48 hours or until the swollen symptoms subside. Joints that are chronically hot and swollen may respond poorly to vigorous heating of any kind.<br><br>


                Implants - Metal pins, rods, artificial joints or any other surgical implants generally reflect infrared waves and thus are not heated by this system. Nevertheless, you should consult your physician prior to using.<br><br>


                Pacemakers / Defibrillators - Please discuss with your doctor the possible risks this may cause.</p>
